          STAR Act (SB 1440):
          The Computer Science department accepts the AS-T in Computer Science for
          transfer into this major.  Students should take courses which clear the American
          Institution requirement and a second course in English composition as part of
          their CSU GE or IGETC requirements for the AS-T degree (doing so will increase
          greater choice in the 60 units of SJSU course work to be taken after transfer).

          Admission to San Jose State is competitive in all majors. SJSU continues to have
          more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Because of this,
          SJSU is an impacted campus with impacted programs.  For the most current
          information regarding admission impaction at SJSU please visit our website:
          www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction

          Prior to transferring to San Jose State University all transfers must earn at
          least 60 transferable semester units (90 quarter), including the CSU four basic
          skill courses required for CSU admission eligibility (except majors which have
          an approved CSU GE A3 waiver). Within those 60 semester/90 quarter units,
          students are strongly encouraged to complete the following:

          1. Lower Division Major Course Requirements (especially for STEM Majors):
          Complete as many of the lower division courses required for the major as
          possible. Many of these courses may be double counted as part of the CSU
          GE-Breadth 39 semester unit requirements. The lower division major courses for
          this major are shown below.

          2. General Education Requirements:
          Complete all the CSU GE Breadth requirements at the community college (39
          semester units/58 quarter units). The approved courses for each area can be
          found at www.ASSIST.org  under the link "CSU GE-Breadth Certification
          Courses" for your college.  Many of these courses may be double counted to meet
          the major requirements shown below, so choose your courses wisely. Some SJSU
          majors which meet GE requirements within the majors are noted on the "
          Exceptions and Modifications" page in our catalog.  Please see your college
          counselor/advisor to review your general education in order to receive FULL OR
          PARTIAL CERTIFICATION PRIOR TO TRANSFER to San Jose State University.

          3. Second Course in English Composition highly recommended:
          All students are strongly encouraged to complete a second English composition
          course as part of their lower division GE prior to transferring to SJSU (either
          to meet CSU GE Area A3 or C2) for the greatest success in passing the Writing
          Skills Test (WST) at SJSU. Complete this course with a grade of "C" or better
          prior to registering for the WST at SJSU to avoid delays in enrollment for other
          SJSU courses. To register for the WST contact our Testing office at:
          http://testing.sjsu.edu/wst

          4. American Institutions Requirement (US 1, US 2, and US 3 must be completed):
          This requirement is normally 2 courses and can be taken as part of your CSU
          GE-Breadth 39 semester unit requirements (GE Area D and sometimes Area C). The
          approved courses can be found at www.ASSIST.org  under the link "CSU US
          History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses" for your college.

          5. Graduation Requirement - Physical Education (PE):  All undergraduate students
          who matriculate at SJSU are required to complete two units of physical education
          from Kinesiology/Dance activity courses, unless the major program has an
